### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"/> I am Mārtiņš.

...

I am a Front-End Developer with experience in Back-End management, drawn to the field of programming for its constant evolution and the endless opportunities for problem-solving and innovation. My passion lies in not only crafting elegant and efficient code but also in the continuous learning journey that programming offers. Eager to expand my skill set, I am committed to staying abreast of new frameworks and technologies, and I thrive in environments where I can contribute to meaningful projects and collaborate with teams to bring creative solutions to life.
